# Notes
- Due to the lack of visits, from both me and others, the product is not publicly accessible as it is not worth the cost to keep it running. Instead, the development version of this is ran on my local system since the traffic will not be high.

- This app is using **Ngrok** to run and forward an SSH tunnel to my localhost. 

- The url is different every day or so because ngrok's free plan does not allow for a domain name. That being said, because there is no limit on the session duration, I will try to keep it on as much as possible but it will have to restart with a new url every other day or so. 

- The production version repository of this project is at this [link](https://github.com/SwayamSahoo11742/KnightStable-product)
