# Notes
- Due to the lack of visits, from both me and others, the product is not publicly accessible as it is not worth the cost to keep it running. Instead, a demo video of this project will be released at the top of the README file at a later date

- This app is using **Ngrok** to run a tunneled version of it so people that I do want to see can see it

- The production version repository of this project is at this [link](https://github.com/SwayamSahoo11742/KnightStable-product)
